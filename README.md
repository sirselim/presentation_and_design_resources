# Presentation and design resources
A small repository to hold useful resources for various courses I teach.

## About

This repository is intended to stimulate interest and awareness in the design aspect of posters – be they scientific or otherwise. It is also a place for me to transition my notes from the many years that I've been teaching some of this content.  It is by no means gospel or complete, as I myself am still learning much.  This is really just a collection of notes, lessons (many learnt the hard way!) and tips that I have gathered over the last few years.  Hopefully after browsing through you’ll come away learning something yourselves – even if it’s just that PowerPoint is not the best piece of software for creating your posters... :)

## Software

Your choice of software can make life much easier (or harder!), so spend some time thinking about what it is you are trying to achieve.

### Open source software (free software) 

These programs can be freely downloaded and installed on any computer (windows, mac, linux), there are numerous tutorials and helpful forums and mailing lists to get you started.  Both Inkscape and Scribus have rich tool sets and can be used to produce results which rival those of the “professional” packages – all for free!

* [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/)
* [Scribus](http://www.scribus.net/)
* [Open Office Draw(http://www.openoffice.org.nz/)]

### “Professional” Software (not free)

Many people would have heard of Abobe Photoshop – well they also make design software in the same vein.  Both Indesign and Illustrator are industry standards – as such they come at a price.  30 day trials may be downloaded if you want to play with them.

* Adobe - http://www.adobe.com/downloads/
  * Indesign
  * Illustrator
* Microsoft Publisher – if you have MS Office you most likely have Publisher.

And then there’s...

* Powerpoint... All I'll say is that it does what it’s made for well, making slide show presentations.  For posters not so much, I’ve listed many other options for a reason.  If you absolutely must use Powerpoint it is possible, just take care as there are quite a few things that can go wrong.

## Colours

There are some really nice online tools to generate great looking colour schemes for your presentation/poster.

* [coolers.co](https://coolors.co/)
  * very easy to use, great options including colour blindness tests 
* [colormind.io](http://colormind.io/)
  * new site using deep-learning, can import an image and generate a colour scheme 
* [paletton.com](https://paletton.com/)
  * an older site but still quite useful if the 2 above don't suit you
