# Presentation and design resources
A small repository to hold useful resources for various courses I teach.

## About

This repository is intended to stimulate interest and awareness in the design aspect of posters – be they scientific or otherwise. It is also a place for me to transition my notes from the many years that I've been teaching some of this content.  It is by no means gospel or complete, as I myself am still learning much.  This is really just a collection of notes, lessons (many learnt the hard way!) and tips that I have gathered over the last few years.  Hopefully after browsing through you’ll come away learning something yourselves – even if it’s just that PowerPoint is not the best piece of software for creating your posters... :)

## Colours

There are some really nice online tools to generate great looking colour schemes for your presentation/poster.

* [coolers.co](https://coolors.co/)
  * very easy to use, great options including colour blindness tests 
* [colormind.io](http://colormind.io/)
  * new site using deep-learning, can import an image and generate a colour scheme 
* [paletton.com](https://paletton.com/)
  * an older site but still quite useful if the 2 above don't suit you
